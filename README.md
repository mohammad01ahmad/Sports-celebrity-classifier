# Sports-celebrity-classifier

<h1>
This project classifies images of three world-famous football icons using computer vision and machine learning.

Why football? Because it’s a sport I watch regularly — and since nobody asked, yes, I’m a proud Manchester City fan 💙</h1>

🔍 How it works

Face & Eye Detection: Images are preprocessed by extracting faces and eyes using Haar Cascade classifiers (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml and haarcascade_eye.xml).

Feature Engineering: Cropped face regions are combined (stacked) with the original images to improve feature representation.

Model Training: Multiple ML models were trained and fine-tuned using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.

Best Model: The final model chosen was Support Vector Machine (Linear kernel), achieving ~89% accuracy on the validation set.

Model Serving: The trained model (best_model.pkl) and class dictionary (class_dict.json) are stored inside the artifacts/ folder. Predictions are served through a Flask REST API.


⚙️ Tech Stack

Python: Data preprocessing, model training, and backend.

OpenCV: Image preprocessing (face/eye detection, cropping).

scikit-learn: Model training, hyperparameter tuning.

Flask: API to serve predictions.

Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS): A simple web interface for image upload and results display.

Note: The frontend code was generated with the help of Claude.ai (I focus more on backend + ML).
